# PharmacyPOSSystem

This was a project carried out as part of the course: Software Engineering II. Utilising an agile methodology for development, this web application consisted of a remote database of pharmacy products, as well as point of sale capabilities. The item counts within the database were updated in real-time, as they were processed at point of sale. Login and authentication features were also implemented, and the web-application supported compatibility with a physical barcode scanner.
